TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I understood clear how to make a word pyramid using a random word file. I learnt different shortcuts to attempt this word pyramid, that being the json bin.
However, it is still unclear to me how to fix the inital written code and also learning how to load json files.
