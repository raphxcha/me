TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Learnt how to list and the world of variables and some python language,
Also discovered in python we start from 0 and not 1.
How ever, I've done all exercise AND for some reason it's saying I haven't. I'll try solve with ben tomorrow :)
I'm getting a lot of anxiety from these.
I don't understand how to fix my errors.
